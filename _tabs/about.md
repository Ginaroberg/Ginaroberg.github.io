<p>Hello, I'm Gina! I am currently a third year undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego.  I am pursuing a Bachelors degree in Data Science and a minor in finance. </p>

<p> Throughout my college career, I have developed strong interests in software development, machine learning, and in artificial intelligence.  I hope to gain experience as a software development or data science intern in the upcoming summers and quarters at UCSD.  In the meantime, you can find what I have been recently working on in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/">Projects!</a> </p>
