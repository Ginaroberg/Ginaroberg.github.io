As s tutor for the DSC 10: Principles of Data Science course, during the Spring 2023 quarter, I created this video as a supplemental resource for the students to prepare for the final.  In this video, I go over the basics of permutation testing, clarify common misconceptions, and perform a live coding demonstration with an example I created from a data set I found from Kaggle.
